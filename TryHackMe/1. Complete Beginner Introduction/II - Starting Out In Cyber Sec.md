# Starting Out In Cyber Sec

# Task 1 - Welcome To TryHackMe 

Okay, we're still in the introduction. You can't wait for interesting challenges right now.

But this room is interesting, as it presents the paths we can take in Cyber ​​Security.

Do you already know what kind of path you want to follow? Offensive Security or Defensive Security? What is the best?

# Task 2 - Offensive Security 

> The first large area within Cyber Security is the offensive side. This area involves attacking different applications and technologies to discover vulnerabilities.
>
> This career is for you if:
>
>   - you enjoy understanding how things work
>   - you are analytical
>   - you like thinking out of the box
>
> The most common offensive security job role is a penetration tester. A penetration tester is an individual that is legally employed by an organisation to find vulnerabilities in their products. A penetration tester usually requires a broad range of knowledge including:
>
>   - web application security
>   - network security
>   - use of programming languages to write various scripts
>   
> More recently, cloud security has also been gaining popularity as various organisations are now shifting their infrastructure to cloud providers such as AWS and Azure.
>
> It's also possible to have a speciality in one of these topics, however a broad knowledge is the best way to start out.
  
Why did you copy this text from there? I decided to copy the definition of Offensive Security that the platform presents us. Because I want you to realize how much [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/startingoutincybersec) guides us in every way. Whether presenting tools, content, technologies or even guiding us on which career best matches our goals.

Now that you know about Offensive Security, let's see a little about Defensive Security in the next subject.

> penetration tester


# Task 3 - Defensive Security

> This is the second major area within Security. While Offensive Security involves actively finding vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within technologies, Defensive Security involves detecting and stopping these attacks.
>
> This career track is for you if:
>
>   - you are analytical
>   - you enjoy problem solving
>
> One of the careers under this track is a Security Analyst. This is an individual in an organisation who's job is to monitor various systems in the organisation and detect whether any of these systems are being attacked. To do this, you need to understand how underlying technologies work and then understand what attacks against these technologies look like.
>
> While a Security Analyst deals with detecting attacks, an Incident Responder is usually brought in once an attack has already occurred. Their main responsibilities include understanding what actions an attacker has taken in the organisation and what the impact of their actions will be. Incident Responders also need to know how underlying technologies work and what potential attacks could be carried out against a system. They then analyse trace evidence left by an attacker.
>
> While this is a very specialist role, malware analysis is quite common when detecting and responding to attacks. Malicious actors would use malicious pieces of software in any stage of their attack cycle from gaining access to a system to maintaining persistence. If you can understand what exactly this malware is doing, you can prevent further abuse and also identify the malicious action.

Pretty cool, yeah? Now that you know how the platform works and what the main roles are, we can finally move on to the next topic.
