# Introductory Researching

# Task 1 - Introduction 

Now that the game is really going to start.

This room is very important, as it teaches us something that is essential to carry out our work as a future **Cyber Security** professional, but not only for that... *research* is something that helps in anything of our life.

How do you intend to know something well without first researching it? *Research* is the basis of everything and with it you will be able to discover a lot.

Despite being part of the introduction, it is possible to learn that crucial elements such as proper ways to do a search, where to search for vulnerabilities (**CVE, DB Exploit, NVD**) and also how to discover features of a command (**Linux**) that you do not know yet.

From now on I will focus on questions and answers. I will leave comments at the end of each room or at the beginning - if the room has an introduction. Thank you for accompanying me on this journey.

# Task 2 - Example Research Question 

<br>

***Question:*** *In the Burp Suite Program that ships with Kali Linux, what mode would you use to manually send a request (often repeating a captured request numerous times)?*

> Repeater

***Question:*** *What hash format are modern Windows login passwords stored in?*

> NTLM

***Question:*** *What are automated tasks called in Linux?*

> Cron Jobs

***Question:*** *What number base could you use as a shorthand for base 2 (binary)?*

> Base 16

***Question:*** *If a password hash starts with $6$, what format is it (Unix variant)?*

> sha512crypt

<br>

# Task 3 - Vulnerability Searching 

<br>

***Question:*** *What is the CVE for the 2020 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in WPForms?*

> CVE-2020-10385

***Question:*** *There was a Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability found in the Debian version of Apache Tomcat, back in 2016. What's the CVE for this vulnerability?*

> CVE-2016-1240

***Question:*** *What is the very first CVE found in the VLC media player?*

> CVE-2007-0017

***Question:*** *If you wanted to exploit a 2020 buffer overflow in the sudo program, which CVE would you use?*

> CVE-2019-18634

<br>

# Task 4 - Manual Pages

<br>

***Question:*** *SCP is a tool used to copy files from one computer to another.
What switch would you use to copy an entire directory?*

> -r

***Question:*** *fdisk is a command used to view and alter the partitioning scheme used on your hard drive.
What switch would you use to list the current partitions?*

> -l

***Question:*** *nano is an easy-to-use text editor for Linux. There are arguably better editors (Vim, being the obvious choice); however, nano is a great one to start with.
What switch would you use to make a backup when opening a file with nano?*

> -B

***Question:*** *Netcat is a basic tool used to manually send and receive network requests. 
What command would you use to start netcat in listen mode, using port 12345?*

> nc -l -p 12345

# Task 5 - Final Thoughts 

I liked. And you too?

Here we had the opportunity to learn a lot, a lot, a lot!

And look, weâ€™re just in the introduction. Imagine everything you will know at the end of this learning path? Do I need to say anything more than **"sign up"** [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) now?

Interesting sites that were used to answer questions from this room:

- [Google for Research](google.com/) (*This is your best friend, never forget about that*)
- [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
- [NVD - National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search)
- [CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/about/index.html)

So we finished the first step of **Complete Beginner**. I hope you enjoyed. Thanks!
