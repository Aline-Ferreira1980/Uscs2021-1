# Tutorial

# Task 1 - Starting your first machine 

Here we are introduced to the platform and the way it works.

Through the web machine known as **AttackBox** we will carry out attacks on a second virtual machine that is started within each subject of the rooms.

For visual reference, I added this material from the platform.

Now that you know how this is going to work, let's see a *practical picture of this scenario*.

Did you like it? That way we will learn step by step, command by command, and line by line, as you will learn and practice at the same time without even changing the screen! Fantastic! [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) does an excellent job providing us with all this.

Now let's get down to business. From now on, there will be no more small talk. I will post the tasks and their solutions. Our first task here is to start an AttackBox, access the IP address of our machine (victim) and then capture the flag.

***Question:*** *Follow the steps in this task. What is the flag text shown on the website of the machine you started on this task?
A flag is just a piece of text that's used to verify you've performed a certain action. In security challenges, users are asked to find flags to prove that they've successfully hacked a machine*

> flag{connection_verified}

Above you can check the response of our first **Task**, so it will be the model that I will make in each room and subject.

# Task 2 - Next Steps

There is no mystery here. Now that we know how the platform works we will choose a learning path. As mentioned in the description of this project, we will focus on **Complete Beginner**, as I am still a mere beginner in this incredible area of Information Security. Are you Ready!?
